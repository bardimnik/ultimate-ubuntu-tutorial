## Why I wrote this ~~another things to do~~ guide
The main reason why I wrote this guide is because I need it as my own memo.

Also because I'm sick of other Ubuntu guides that are often written by idiots!
Most often they are useless and written with only one purpose - to collect traffic from Google.
And they all are almost the same, copy each other or even tell you such stupid dead-simple things like
Skype installation from Ubuntu Software Center.
Hi SEO! :fu: you SEO!

Also most of guides are written for the very beginners or for fresh *swithchers*.
I'm pretty sure that you've seen a lot of Ubuntu Linux  installation guides here and there across the web.
All these blogs for n00bs like OMG!Ubuntu! or Webupd8 you know them...
So something more complicated must be written.

OK. So what makes this guide different?  
It is for more hard-cored PC users and **It is applicable to reality.**  

And thats why:

- I have been using Linux as my only OS for desktop and servers for more than 10 years on all my desktops and servers
- I always use this guide as my memo to set up my new machine
- I do work, travel and I make money using my Linux laptop
- Also this guide tries to be simple yet extremely effective in a real life

So enough talking and let the fun begin!
